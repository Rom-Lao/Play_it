# project name

**project name** is like a playlist, where you can discover (my) preferred Kpop songs, the **full** song is **not** played, but rather the **best part** of it.


# Features
Song information are displayed in a card, which shows an image of the artist, and at the bottom it shows the song title.
You can move to the next song or go to the previous one using controls.
You can either pause/play the song.
Song volume is set to minimum so you shouldn't worry about your ears.
Each time you change the song, the background image also change.
